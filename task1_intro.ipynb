    "Very good tutorials can be found on the [mumax3 examples page](http://mumax.github.io/examples.html)\n",
    "## Steps of modeling:\n",
    "### Static and dynamic simulations:\n",
    "1.  Definition of the mesh (discretization), i.e., lateral dimensions of the system under study, cell size, periodic boundary conditions if needed (with the number of repetitions)\n",
    "2.  Definition of the geometry\n",
    "3.  Definition of regions that can have different magnetic parameters\n",
    "4.  Definition of magnetic parameters ($M_\\text{S}$, $A_\\text{ex}$, $\\alpha$ ....) which then be matched to particular regions\n",
    "5.  Definition of the initial magnetization configuration (if we do not specify it, mumax will start from the random magnetic configuration), example.: `m = uniform(0.1, 1.0, 0)`\n",
    "6.  Definition of the external magnetic field\n",
    "7.  System relaxation/stabilization, functions `relax()` or `minimize()`\n",
    "--------------------------\n",
    "### Dynamic simulations only:\n",
    "8.  Selection of solver and discretization in time\n",
    "9.  Definition of the sampling (frequency of the data saving)\n",
    "10. dynamic simulations( function: `run(float how_long)` or `RunWhile(bool condition)`)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to run a simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Scripts with simulations must have `.mx3` extension (`myfile.mx3`)!\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a simulation, right-click a `.mx3` file and select `run code` or open the file and click on the arrow in the top right corner of the editor. Don't forget to save it before!\n",

    "\n",
    "To relax the system you can use command: `relax()` or `minimize()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Important: sometimes, an error can occur when simulations are initiated from an ideally saturated configuration, e.g. `m = uniform(0, 0, 1)`. It is a bug. In order to avoid such an issue, better to set an almost ideally saturated system: `m = uniform(1e-7, 0, 1)`. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PNG files -- `Snapshot(q Quantity, fname string)` \n",
    "\n",

    "To save data you can use `Snapshot(m)`, `Snapshot(m.comp(2))` or `saveas(m, \"m_stab\")`. The last option give you a full information about the magnetic configuration whereas `Snapshot` function generate png files. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Zarr files -- `SaveAs(q Quantity, fname string)`, `AutoSave(q Quantity, period float64)` \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to save some quantity from simulations (`m, m.comp(), B_ext, B_demag, ...`) one may use `SaveAs` function saving the vector (or scalar) fields as a zarr array: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`SaveAs(q Quantity, fname string)` \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "for example: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`SaveAs(B_ext.comp(2), \"B_ext_z\")` \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it would be more usefull to **generate filenames automatically**. For instance, one can introduce to the name value of some variables, e.g., `B_ext`: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "` saveas(m,Sprintf(\"m_field%3.4f\",B_ext)) ` \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of dynamic simulations, it is more convenient to save data with a precise sampling interval. In order to do so, we can use: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`AutoSave(q Quantity, period float64)` \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "for instance: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`AutoSave(m, 2e-11)` \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "that will autosave magnetization (all three components) with the interval of 20 ps. It gives a resolution up to 25 GHz in the spectral domain. "
